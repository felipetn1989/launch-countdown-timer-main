## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, the countdown will always start at 14 days no matter what time it is when the user opens the page, just for demonstration purposes. I still haven't done the flipping animation part, but plan on studying how to do it to complete the bonus objective. Feedback is welcome!

### Continued development

Implement a flipping animation for the clock
